give permission for a folder, e.g if you're permitting inside the folder:
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./
- The -R option stands for recursively for every content inside that folder, target the user you want to permit and ./ is the path for the folder

To kill a port that stuck opened:
sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:3000)

# cloudflare
More details for the settings at:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrangler

For setting the wrangler to communicate and authenticate with R2 API:
npm install wrangler --save-dev
The setting then will have to be in your wrangler.toml file

Next type:
wrangler login

Next type:
npm install -g wrangler

Then run this command:
wrangler secret put R2_API_TOKEN
insert your r2 token

Finally, after setting the worker.js file, you can deploy it, so run:
npx wrangler deploy

Be sure to have your creds/tokens protected somewhere like a .env file
